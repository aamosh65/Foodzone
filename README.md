Food Zone
Food Zone is a React app that displays a list of foods and lets users filter them by category and search term in real time, using a Vite + styled-components setup similar to common React starter projects.
​

Features
Search bar that filters foods by name as you type (case-insensitive).
​

Category pills (Allfoods, Lunch, Dinner, Breakfast, Dessert) to filter by category, with “Allfoods” showing every item.

Combined filtering: results match both the selected category and the search text.

Responsive card layout for each food item.
